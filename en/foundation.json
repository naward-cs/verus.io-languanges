Unlike other projects, Verus had no premine or ICO; funding which often goes into the pockets of a few, or can be dumped on the market at will. No venture capitalists or other obscured and parasitic entities dictate project direction. Who determines the direction of Verus you might ask yourself? You are. You are the community. Verus is uniquely positioned as a network for the public, made by the public. And nothing ever changes that."

It is fair to conclude Verus is resistant to 51% hash attacks. On top of that, you can set up vaults to protect your wealth. Use Verus Vault for vesting periods, trusts and inheritance. And secure yourself against hacks, theft, key loss and even “5$ wrench attacks.” Use the network with peace of mind, short and long-term."

Creating an unprecedented network of blockchains that can grow and scale each direction. Miners can merge-mine up to 22 blockchains on the multichain network at once with no loss of performance, and can stake on any number of chains. The whole network shares mining power, increasing the total strength of the network, making unlimited scalability possible."

The network achieves high-grade decentralization through the combination of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. The miner ecosystem is naturally decentralized because you don’t need specialized equipment to start mining. You can mine most cost-efficiently with consumer-grade CPUs, mobile phones and ARM devices. A great source of income for people in developing countries. Staking has never been easier. You only need a full node running on even modest hardware (a Raspberry Pi does the job), and any amount of $VRSC, there is no minimum and your funds aren't locked up while you're staking. Combined with a worldwide network of supporters and contributors, Verus is one of the most decentralized networks in the crypto industry."

The whole network shares mining power, making optimal use of all available miners, and strengthening the total network at the same time. Truly a green mining revolution. As for proof-of-stake, it has a negligible environmental impact, evidenced by the fact that Raspberry Pi’s are perfect staking devices."

You can see many problems arise with smart contracts on other blockchain systems. Vulnerabilities, bugs, abuse. New smart contract incidents occur each day. Not with Verus.

Meaning they extract value and negatively impact unassuming users. Or even worse, miners and stakers reorganize blockchains for monetary gain, jeopardizing chain security. The problem is called Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and is widely recognized. Verus solves the problem in an incredibly smart way. All conversions are simultaneously solved inside blocks, making it impossible to front-run users. And there’s more to keep miners and stakers honest without jeopardizing chain security. All protocol fees are collected in the Verus Fee Pool. Each new block receives 1% of the Fee Pool, added on top of the coinbase rewards. It’s a great way to keep the chain secure. And the network fair for all participants involved."
